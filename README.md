# turtile üê¢
A simple and customizable tiling Wayland compositor based on [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots)

# Overview
turtile was started as a passion and learning project, with the objective of getting a usable compositor that provides a customizable experience. It was written in C using [tinywl](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/tinywl) as a base.

# Features
- Flexible CLI system for interactig with the compositor
- Easy to parse JSON output for the shell script enjoyers
- Readable config file making use of [libconfig](https://github.com/hyperrealm/libconfig)
- Support for vitually infinite desktops (haven't tried infinite, maybe stick with 50 max...)
- User defined keybinds that can run any shell command
